# âœ… TODO for `oko-lang`
This file is a todo list for the `oko` programming language. Things that are listed here are being developed at the moment or will be in the near future.

- [x] ~~Rewriting the language (at least partially) from JS to a different language, f.e. **C** / **C++** / **Rust** / **Lua** (remember LuaJIT). This will give the language more performance, stability and much more. Also the hype train will come and pick up the language (last one was a local joke).~~ **(kudos to [S1monr3dst0ne07](https://github.com/S1monr3dst0ne07))**
- [ ] Add all of the missing builtins to the Rust version of **oko-lang**
